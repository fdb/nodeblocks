Nodeblocks
==========
Nodeblocks is a HTML 5 application for visual designers.

It gives the power of <canvas> to mere mortals.

Features
--------
Operations are represented by visual blocks, called nodes. Operations can be 
connected together in a non-linear flow.

Data is represented as a table. Nodes operate on single data-structure, and 
the application does the looping. This allows it to use webworkers or WebCL.
